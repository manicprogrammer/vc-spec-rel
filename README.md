# Verifiable Credentials Specification Relationship Map
diagrams and documentation on the relationship of verfiable credential specifications.

The current release contains some of the most core specifications and their related specs in a diagram.
It does not yet address some of the items especially under DIF work groups for secure data storage, SIOP, Sidetree etc.

There are likely all sorts of things missed but for anyone trying to get a hanlde on the space using this diagram and working through it will provide a significant leg up and help mitigate some confusion.

Corrections welcome. This is a work in progress.

Current release contains a draw.io diagram that will open freely in a browser and can even be edited. It also contains the primary diagram output as a png.
